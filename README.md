# Improved-Collision-Detection-Of-MD5

## Verification of ASC
The differential paths constructed by HashClash are in file `lower_minAndmax` and `lower_minAndmax1`. 
Message differences in lower_minAndmax use type 1 difference and message differences in lower_minAndmax1 use type 2 difference. 
Each message difference has the minimum and maximum conditions path.


## Detection Algorithm Integrated With ASC
compile

`$ make`

use

`$ ./collisionDetect`
